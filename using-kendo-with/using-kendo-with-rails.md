# Using Kendo with Ruby on Rails

In this article, I'll show you how to get up and running with Kendo UI in Ruby on Rails applications. In particular, I cover using the [kendoui-rails Gem][1], though the concepts in this article are the same if you are using a fully-licensed version of Kendo UI.

### `kendoui-rails`: A Ruby Gem for Rails Apps

Ruby on Rails developers love speeding up common development tasks, and we do too. As such, we created the [kendoui-rails][1] gem to get Kendo UI into your Rails apps with little manual effort on your part. If you're using the Rails 3.1+ [Asset Pipeline][4], you can get up and running with Kendo UI with two simple commands. Even if not, or if you're using an older version of Rails, this gem will get you rolling with Rails faster.

If you want the sources, check it out over at [http://github.com/telerik/kendoui_rails][2], and feel free to fork it, send us pull-requests, enter issues or offer any other kind of feedback you think we need. 

> The kendo-rails gem provides a GPLv3-licensed version of the latest major release of Kendo UI Web. If you own a licensed version of Kendo UI DataViz or Kendo UI Mobile and you want to use the Gem, you can create a private fork and extend the pipeline references below.

### Installing the `kendoui-rails` Gem

To start using rails with Kendo UI, create a new Rails application:

	$ rails new shoe_fodder
 	$ cd shoe_fodder

Then, edit your Gemfile by adding a reference to the gem, just after `gem 'jquery-rails'`:

	gem 'kendoui-rails'

> Because Kendo UI depends on jQuery, kendoui-rails depends on the jquery-rails gem, so make sure to add a reference to this gem as well if it's no longer in your Gemfile for some reason.

Now, return to your console and run `bundle install.` Check that wall of text that Bundler sends your way to confirm that kendoui-rails has been properly installed.

### Installing Kendo UI Assets

The kendoui-rails Gem includes a custom install generator that will make sure you have all the JavaScript and CSS you need to get going with Kendo. To use it, type the following in your console:

	$ rails generate kendoui:install

Depending on your Rails version and environment, one of two things will happen in this step: 

* If you're using Rails 3.1 or later, and have the new asset pipeline features enabled (they are, by default) the Gem will add the appropriate references to your `app/assets/javascripts/application.js` and `app/assets/stylesheets/application.css` files:

		// app/assets/javascripts/application.js
		//= require kendo/kendo.all.min

		/* app/assets/stylesheets/application.css */
		*= require kendo/kendo.common.min
		*= require kendo/kendo.default.min

* If, on the other hand, you're using Rails 3.0 or previous, or have the asset pipeline disabled, the Gem will manually copy all the needed assets into the `public/` folder of your app. From there, you'll need to add the proper `<link>` and `<script>` references for Kendo UI.

### Specifying an Alternate Theme

Kendo UI ships with several out-of-the-box themes that you can use in your apps. In the example above, the default theme was installed into our app, but the Rails generator for the kendoui-rails gem provides a handy switch that you can use to specify another theme, if you wish. For instance, let's say I want my app to use the BlueOpal theme:

	$ rails generate kendoui:install --theme=blueopal

### Using Rails with Kendo UI

Once the generator command completes, I have everything I need to start using Kendo UI in my Rails app. I'll start with some quick scaffolding and run the following in my terminal to generate a `shoe` model, including views and controller:

	$ rails g scaffold shoe name price:decimal url replacement_mileage

Once that's finished, I'll migrate the database:

	$ rake db:migrate

Now, to add a Kendo UI widget. I'll navigate to my `shoes/new` view and add some Kendo goodness to the bottom of the page. In this case, an [AutoComplete][5] box that provides some assistance to the user when naming a new shoe:

	<script>
      $(function() {
      		var shoes = ["Nike Free", "Saucony Series 7", "Vibram Five Fingers"];
            $("#shoe_name").kendoAutoComplete(shoes);
      });
    </script>

Next, I'll start up my server

	$ rails server

And finally, open up a browser at `localhost:3000/shoes/new`.
