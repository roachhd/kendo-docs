In this article you will learn how [OpenAccess ORM](http://www.telerik com/products/orm.aspx) can be leveraged on the backend, and [Kendo UI](http://www.telerik.com/kendo-ui) can take care of the UI.

## Getting Set Up

To get started create a new **ASP.Net** **Empty Web Application. **

![New Web Project](/images/oa1.png)

*Note: You can really use any web based project template you like, in this walkthrough you will be starting from scratch.*

Once the project loads, fire up the [NuGet](http://nuget.org/) Package Manager Console.

Add JQuery to the project using the command:

    Install-Package jQuery

Add KendoUI to the project using the command:

    Install-Package KendoUIWeb

Once you run both of these NuGet commands, the solution explorer should look
like this:![Solution After Installing jQuery And Kendo UI](/images/oa2.png)

Now we are ready to build the OpenAccess ORM model!

*Note: If you are not familiar with NuGet, or would rather just download, and
add the needed files manually. Kendo UI is available [here](http://www.telerik.com/download/kendo-ui-complete), and Jquery is available [here](http://jquery.com/).*

## Building The Model

To build an OpenAccess ORM data model, right click on the web project,
navigate to **Add** > **New Item**, then select **Telerik OpenAccess Domain
Model**.

*Note: If you do not have OpenAccess ORM installed, you can get the trial
edition [here](http://www.telerik.com/download-trial-file.aspx?pid=638).*

![Build The Model](/images/oa3.png)

Make sure to give the model a name, and then click **Add**.

In the next window select **Populate from Database**, and click **Next**.

![Populate From Data](/images/oa4.png)

Set up a connection to NorthwindOA, which is installed with OpenAccess, and
then click next.

![Connect To NorthwindOA](/images/oa5.png)

At this point go ahead and include all tables from the database in the data
model.

Click finish, and step 2 is done!  The data model is ready to be used.  The
next step is to expose this data model through a service layer.

## Building The Service Layer

Perform a **build** on the application, and right click on the .rlinq file in the
solution explorer. Select **Generate OpenAccess Domain Model Service…**, and the domain service wizard will fire up.

*Note: please ensure you **build** the project before you launch the wizard. If you do not do this, you will not be able to see the domain model in the service wizard as shown below.*

![Service Wizard](/images/oa8.png)

Select the NorthwindOA context in the wizard, and click Next.

![Select Northwind OA](/images/oa9.png)

This screen allows you to configure the service that will be created.  Give the service a name, select the **WCF Data Services V2 tab**, and then click Finish.

![Configure The Service](/images/oa10.png)

In about 3 clicks you created an OData service which exposes the domain model.

## Connecting the OData Service to a Kendo Grid

Now all that is left to do is configure the front end.  For now we will wire up the Orders to a KendoUI grid, but feel free to take it even further! KendoUI has a lot of cool features to play around with.

First thing we need to do is add a new *html* page to the project. So once again, right click on the project in the solution explorer, select **Add** > **New Item**, only this time choose HTML Page and name the page **default.htm** and then click **Add.**

![Add HTML Page](/images/oa11.png)

Now we need to add the needed Kendo files, so add the following lines in the head section:

    <link href="Content/common.css" rel="stylesheet"/>
    <link href="Content/2012.3.1114/kendo.common.min.css" rel="stylesheet" />
    <link href="Content/2012.3.1114/kendo.default.min.css" rel="stylesheet"/>
    <script src="Scripts/jquery-1.7.1.min.js"></script>
    <script src="Scripts/2012.3.1114/kendo.all.min.js"></script>

Next, we need to set up the grid.  KendoUI’s web site provides many [great examples](http://demos.telerik.com/kendo-ui/web/grid/index.html) of how to configure binding; so I won’t go into too much detail here.  The basic idea is that we need a div that will be used as the container for the KendoUI grid, and then we just have to configure the grid in script.

The code needed is here:

    <!--Will be turned into a kendo-ized grid! -->
    <div id="grid"></div>

    <!-- configure grid-->
    <script>

        // document ready fires when the whole page is ready
        // and all elements, scripts, styles have been loaded
        $(function () {

            // regex for some date parsing
            var dateRegExp = /^\/Date\((.*?)\)\/$/;

            // a function to convert the date to a different
            // format
            function toDate(value) {
                var date = dateRegExp.exec(value);
                return new Date(parseInt(date[1]));
            }

            // select the div and create the grid element
            $("#grid").kendoGrid({
                dataSource: {
                    type: "odata",
                    transport: {
                        read: "/NorthwindService.svc/Orders"
                    },
                    schema: {
                        model: {
                            fields: {
                                OrderID: { type: "number" },
                                Freight: { type: "number" },
                                ShipName: { type: "string" },
                                OrderDate: { type: "date" },
                                ShipCity: { type: "string" }
                            }
                        }
                    },
                    pageSize: 10,
                    serverPaging: true,
                    serverFiltering: true,
                    serverSorting: true
                },
                filterable: true,
                sortable: true,
                pageable: true,
                columns: [
                    {
                        field: "OrderID",
                        filterable: false
                    },
                    "Freight",
                    {
                        field: "OrderDate",
                        template: '#= kendo.toString(toDate(OrderDate), "MM/dd/yyyy") #'
                    },
                    "ShipName",
                    "ShipCity"
                ]
            });

        });

    </script>

Now run the application, and navigate to default.htm.  If all went well you should be presented with a great looking *empty* grid:

![Empty Grid](/images/oa12.png)

So what gives?!  Why is there no data in the grid?  Well if you take a look at firebug/Chrome/F12 tools you should see something like:

Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 400 (Bad
Request)

This error by itself is not very helpful, but if you navigate to the page it tried to retrieve, something like:

    http://localhost:11224/NorthwindService.svc/Orders?$format=json&$inlinecount= allpages&$callback=callback&$top=10

You will be greeted with this error:

The query parameter '$format' begins with a system-reserved '$' character but is not recognized.

## We Need JSON

KendoUI uses JSON to communicate with an OData service; but WCF Data Services does not support JSON *out of the box.*  To enable support for JSON, you can download the needed code from the [Microsoft Code Gallery](http://archive.msdn.microsoft com/DataServicesJSONP).

Once you have added the needed code to the project, and you add the needed reference to **System.Runtime.Serialization.dll**, navigate to NorthwindService.svc.cs (Your name might be different).

In the service add the **JSONPSupportBehavior** attribute:

    [System.ServiceModel.ServiceBehavior(IncludeExceptionDetailInFaults=true)]
    [JSONPSupportBehavior]
    public partial class NorthwindService : OpenAccessDataService<KendoUIOAOData.EntitiesModel>
    {
        //Rest of code omitted for berevity
        .....

Run the application one more time, and this time, you should be greeted by a great looking *populated* grid.

## Conclusions

The OpenAccess ORM Visual Designer and Service Layer Generator make it extremely easy to get started working with KendoUI.  In fact, we only had to write 1 line of server side code thanks to these great tools!

You can see complete code sample in this [gist](https://gist.github.com/1755775).
